# Go Microservices (gRPC)

## NOTES:
- **Hexagonal architecture** (clean architecture): to separate and isolate layers in microservices to implement maintainble and clean applications
- **Ports**: defining contracts between layers (interfaces)
- **Adapters**: concrete implementations to ports to make the core application available to end user
